I have done a project called rock,papper,scissors game using python.I have implemented the libraries random and tkinter.
The intention of this game is,the user competes with computer,
if the user wins his point increase by one,same rule for if computer wins, 
if it is a tie, then no points are calculated. 
Random library:
     This library is used to make choices in behalf of the computer as either Rock,paper or scissors. 
Tkinter:
     I have used tkinter for GUI,as it may be more interactive and provides the human the feel of real game.
